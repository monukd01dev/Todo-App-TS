# TODO-TS

**TODO-TS** is a simple, fully-functional TODO application built with TypeScript, designed to offer a streamlined task management experience. This app allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks, with all task data stored locally in the browserâ€™s localStorage, ensuring persistence across sessions. Initially a learning project, **TODO-TS** is practical for real-life use.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Quickly add new tasks to your list with an intuitive interface.
- **Mark Todo as Completed**: Easily mark tasks as completed to track progress.
- **Delete Todo**: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.
- **Persistent Storage**: Todos are saved in localStorage, ensuring they are available across sessions.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improved tooling.
- **Vite**: Bundler used for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides responsive, customizable styling.
- **DOM API**: Uses native DOM manipulation for simplicity and direct control.

## How It Works

1. **Adding a Todo**: New tasks are added to the list and saved in localStorage.
2. **Marking as Completed**: Clicking on a task marks it as completed.
3. **Deleting a Todo**: Click delete to remove a task from both UI and localStorage.
4. **LocalStorage Persistence**: On page load, the app retrieves and displays the todo list from localStorage, ensuring all tasks are available across sessions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-ts.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Todo-App-TS
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Run the project**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Vite will start a development server, and you can access the app at the provided local URL.

## Usage

- **Adding a Todo**: Enter your task and click the "Add" button.
- **Completing a Todo**: Click a task to mark it as completed.
- **Deleting a Todo**: Click the "Delete" button next to any task to remove it.

## Project Motivation

TODO-TS was created as part of my journey to learn and practice TypeScript. This project provided hands-on experience with TypeScript while using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and the DOM API to build a practical, real-world application.
